 # Taxi Calendar

 An application for Theta Xi actives to compile all calendar information into one place

  ## Proposal

   ### Purpose

  The purpose of this application is to assist Theta Xi actives, particularly those within the scholarship program, 
  in organizing and displaying their due dates, class schedule, work schedule, and fraternity schedule in one place.

   ### Layout

   Once completed, this application will allow users to add their classes, due dates, and work schedule information, 
   which will populate into a calendar. This information will be coupled with the Fraternity's Google Calendar (Using 
   Google's Calender API, hopefully) to allow actives the ability to have all their information on the same calendar.

   ### Justification

   The justification for developing an application such as this was to be able to give members of the scholarship 
   program the ability to keep themselves organized. The chapter does not have the ability to provide each member of 
   the scholarship program a physical alternative, so this approach is the only way to provide that solution.

   Once implemented and properly maintained, this application will enable the members of the Delta Alpha scholarship 
   program to stay vigilant in regards to due dates and fraternity events. There will no longer be the "I forgot" excuse.

   Creating an application such as this also allows members to always have all these events ready at their fingertips. 
   For example, a member could set this application to launch upon startup of their computer, which means that any time 
   they are doing work, they have their calendar in front of them, and readily accessible. It also allows modifications to 
   be made easier. While sitting in class, members can quickly insert a due date, which means that they no longer need 
   to rely solely on Canvas and verbal communication for their due dates. 

 # Project Status

 This project is currently in the planning stage. There is no code written as of yet, and there is no application available to run.

 # Technical Information

  ## Dependencies

  This project plans to make use of Swing, as well as the Google Calendar API. More information on these and their uses within this 
  project will be added at a later date.
